# Data Science Portfolio
Portfolio with my Data Science and Advanced Analytics master projects
# Business Cases Projects
This folder contains projects made with real data (most of them), and they all aim at the following points:
- Model business cases in accordance to the CRISP-DM process model
- Identify and implement the most adequate analytical models to different business cases
- Interpret models results from both a data science and a business perspective
- Make data-driven decisions to optimize business processes

## Market Basket Analysis
**Group Project for University**<br/>
**Python**<br/>
**The data for this project was private so i can only provide the report and presentation**<br/>
The analyzed data belong to a restaurant and the goal for this project was to perform a MBA to obtain useful patterns to create new products and/or new menus for the restauran. The steps were:
1.	Data exploratory analysis to try to find interesting patterns, taking advantage of data visualization to demonstrate any relevant patterns.
2.	Preprocessing the data and feature engineering.
3.	Do a market basket analysis using an Apriori Algorithm and Association Rules to try to answer the business questions.
4.	Based on the patterns and insights obtained present recommendations aligned with the restaurents objectives.

## Prediction of Booking Cancellations
**Group Project for University**<br/>
**Python**<br/>
The analyzed data belong to a hotel and the goal for this project was to build a model to predict cancellations. The steps were:
1.	Data exploratory analysis to try to find interesting patterns, taking advantage of data visualization to demonstrate any relevant patterns.
2.	Preprocessing the data and feature engineering.
3.	Try different models to answer the business questions such as: Logistic Regression; Random Forest; Multi Layer Perceptron; Gradient Tree Boosting; XGBoost.
4.	In the end the best model find was XGBoost and in addiction was made an Hyperparameter Tuning with Optuna.

## Demand Forecasting
**Group Project for University**<br/>
**Python**<br/>
**The data for this project was private so i can only provide the report and presentation**<br/>
The analyzed data belong to a transfer service and the goal for this project was to build a model to weekly forecast the number of services according the business objectives. The steps were:
1.	Data exploratory analysis to try to find interesting patterns, taking advantage of data visualization to demonstrate any relevant patterns.
2.	Preprocessing the data and feature engineering.
3.	Try different models to answer the business questions such as: Ensemble models; Linear Models and Neural Networks.
4.	In the end the best model find was a fully connects Neural Network.

# Data Mining Project
**Group Project for University**<br/>
**Python** <br/>
This project consisted in performing the segmentation of clients of a fictitious insurance company. The steps were:
1.	Data exploratory analysis to try to find interesting patterns, taking advantage of data visualization to demonstrate any relevant patterns and pre-processing.
2.	Preprocessing the data and feature engineering.
3.	Try different clustering techniques to answer the business questions such as: K-means and K-modes respectively for numerical and categorical values; Hierarchical; Self Organizing Maps; DBSCAN.
4.	Were applied as well some methods to evaluate the quality of clusters and clustering technique like: Intra-cluster distances; Silhouette scores and graph.
5.	In the end the best model find was K-means and we end up with 6 different clusters.

# Data Visualization
**Group Project for University**<br/>
**Python**<br/>
**https://visualization19.herokuapp.com/**<br/>
This goal for this project was to show how you managed and use visualization concepts and techniques to transform data into a meaningful interactive visualization. The Dataset picked for this project is called "World Happiness" and was found on Kaggle. The final version of the project was deployed in to "Herokuapp" and is possible to have a look in the link above.

# Machine Learning
This folder contains different projects and Machine Learning methods are used in each of them.

## Return Guest
**Individual Project for University**<br/>
**Python**<br/>
The analyzed data belong to a fictional hotel chain and the goal for this project was to build a predictive model that answers the question “Which guests are more likely to return?”. The only model that we could use was Neural Networks. The steps were:
1.	Data exploratory analysis to try to find interesting patterns, taking advantage of data visualization to demonstrate any relevant patterns.
2.	Preprocessing the data and feature engineering.
3.	Apply Neural Network and was tried as well to optimized using Grid Search.

## Strange Churn
**Individual Project for University**<br/>
**Python**<br/>
The analyzed data belong to a fictional company and the goal for this project is to build a predictive model that answers the question “What people are more likely to quit their position at the company?”. The only you could apply were K-Nearest Neighbors, Bayes or Logistic Regression. The steps were:
1.	Data exploratory analysis to try to find interesting patterns, taking advantage of data visualization to demonstrate any relevant patterns.
2.	Preprocessing the data and feature engineering.
3.	Apply the different possible models.
4.	In the end the best model find was K-Nearest Neighbors.
